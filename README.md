# Procedural Jellyfish

## Project Description 

For this project, I procedurally modeled a jellyfish :) 

The bell and the arms were made using the following tutorials: [Jellyfish Bell Setup Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3X8BB0yNRE) and [Jellyfish Arms Setup Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_oNXqx8XH4).

The veins were created using the shortest path node in Houdini. 

The tentacles were made using this tutorial: [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LN4XXaHQkmU). 

The organs were created by using a line and bending it to create a curved shape. I also used a ramp to adjust the extrusion at different points to create bumps. 

The colors were added using the standard shader and an environmental light that gave everything a nice blue hue.
